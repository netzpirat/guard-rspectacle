# Guard::RSpectacle [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/netzpirat/guard-rspectacle.png)](http://travis-ci.org/netzpirat/guard-rspectacle)

Guard::RSpectacle automatically tests your application with [RSpec]() when files are modified.

Tested on MRI Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, REE and the latest versions of JRuby & Rubinius.

If you have any questions please join us on our [Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/guard-dev) or on `#guard`
(irc.freenode.net).

## Prove of concept

**This is an early stage proof of concept. The idea is that Guard starts the Rails environment, reloads changed Ruby files and starts the RSpec runner embedded in the current process.**

## Install

### Guard and Guard::RSpectacle

Please be sure to have [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) installed.

Add it to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :development
  gem 'guard-rspectacle'
end
```

and install it by running Bundler:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Add the guard definition to your `Guardfile` by running this command:

```bash
$ guard init rspectacle
```

## Usage

Please read the [Guard usage documentation](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme) for information about Guard.

## Guardfile

Guard::RSpectacle can be adapted to all kind of projects. Please read the
[Guard documentation](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme) for more information about the Guardfile DSL.

```ruby
guard :rspectacle do
  watch('spec/spec_helper.rb')                        { %w(spec/spec_helper spec) }
  watch('config/routes.rb')                           { %w(config/routes.rb spec/routing) }
  watch('app/controllers/application_controller.rb')  { 'spec/controllers' }

  watch(%r{^spec/.+_spec\.rb$})

  watch(%r{^app/(.+)\.rb$})                           { |m| ["app/#{m[1]}.rb", "spec/#{m[1]}_spec.rb"] }
  watch(%r{^lib/(.+)\.rb$})                           { |m| ["lib/#{m[1]}.rb", "spec/lib/#{m[1]}_spec.rb"] }
  watch(%r{^app/controllers/(.+)_controller\.rb$})    { |m| [
    "app/controllers/#{m[1]}_controller.rb",
    "spec/controllers/#{m[1]}_spec.rb",
    "spec/routing/#{m[1]}_routing_spec.rb",
    "spec/acceptance/#{m[1]}_spec.rb"
  ]}
end
```

**NOTE: When using `watch` with a block, you must return all files that should be reloaded.**

## Options

There are many options that can customize Guard::RSpectacle to your needs. Options are simply supplied as hash when
defining the Guard in your `Guardfile`:

```ruby
guard :rspectacle, :cli => '--format Fuubar --backtrace --tag @focus', :all_on_start => false do
  ...
end
```

### General options

The general options configures the environment that is needed to run Guard::RSpectacular and RSpec:

```ruby
:cli => '--tag @focus'         # RSpec CLI options
                               # default: ''
```

### Spec runner options

The spec runner options configures the behavior driven development (or BDD) cycle:

```ruby
:all_on_start => false         # Run all specs on start.
                               # default: true

:keep_failed => false          # Keep failed examples and add them to the next run again.
                               # default: true

:keep_pending => false         # Keep pending examples and add them to the next run again.
                               # default: true

:all_after_pass => false       # Run all specs after all examples have passed again after failing.
                               # default: true
```

### System notifications options

These options affects what system notifications (growl, libnotify or notifu) are shown after a spec run:

```ruby
:notifications => false        # Show success and error notifications.
                               # default: true

:hide_success => true          # Disable successful spec run notification.
                               # default: false
```

## Important note on reloading

The ability to run specs immediately comes at a cost:

1. In your `Guardfile`, you have to specify which files should be reloaded (apart from specs to be executed).  But don't
   worry, the default template takes care of it.
2. When a file is changed, it is reloaded the Ruby code with
   [Kernel#load](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Kernel.html#method-i-load), which only re-interprets the file.

This, for example, means that a method already defined on a class (including `initialize`) will not be removed
simply by deleting that method from the source code:

```ruby
class Dinner
  def initialize
    raise "Too early"
  end
end
```

The spec that uses this class will fail for the obvious reason. So your first thought may be to just remove `initialize`
method. But that will not work and you should rewrite the class above:

```ruby
class Dinner
  def initialize
    super
  end
end
```

When you are done testing, restart `guard` to load the file afresh. Unfortunately this inconvenience can't be fixed
easily (suggest if you know how?). So just keep in mind: **you are monkey-patching within a single `guard` session**.

## Alternatives

Please have a look at the rock solid [guard-rspec](https://github.com/guard/guard-rspec). Guard::Rspectacular uses it
for continuous testing.

## Issues
